# Support Me

Thank you so much for your interest in my work! If you enjoy what I create and feel like supporting me, I would truly appreciate it — but only if you want to and it’s within your means. Please never feel pressured; **your support means more when it’s genuine and comfortable for you.**

There are two ways to sponsor me until June 2025:

## 1. Donate via Platform

I’m currently using [Unifans](https://app.unifans.io/c/somerui), which accepts many payment methods.

- Supported PayPal
- Supported crypto networks: ERC-20, TRC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, coins: **USDT, USDC**

If you don’t have these payment methods, you can buy vouchers from third-party sellers, who might support more payment options, especially for Mainland China.<br>(Note: fees might be higher than directly buy on official.)

and, [Patreon](https://patreon.com/c/somerui) is available too! but free post only because I don't have a bank card or PayPal account to receive moneys.

## 2. Send Crypto Directly

You can also send crypto directly to these addresses:

- **BTC:**  
  - Native SegWit: `bc1qjdn8kea6xx9a5eah2l46zh56ruqlt479l750jp`  **(recommend)**
  - Legacy: `1DnhMwH4iva5DPyuaTh7jacrHkJyRNjc3N` (not recommend)

- **ETH:** `0xb8aF657B51C1B423CEF996f6da0344EdD363c312`  **(recommend)**

- **LTC:**  
  - Native SegWit: `ltc1qtywlz85c5r5q3h5gxe9qs8k5g6p97sn7xag2wy`  
  - Legacy: `LP3SirhBYN6ekyRfxVP9ibUcJdty4q4rJ9`

- **BCH:** `bitcoincash:qzegznkw6mk5sxzx9wprevdln3e3kxkavy2ffykaql`  

- **SOL:** `Hw8dRW4D6wTUm1Dk6F5TNaXqCKh7DxeDs8BiCn2msVZQ`

or.. 

## ~~3. Send money to my PayPal directly?~~

Nah, just for joke. I'm just 16 and I can't open a PayPal account until June 17,2027(18y.o. 's day). Wait for that day!

Same reason of why I can't receive rewards on Patreon.

Thank you again for your support —— no matter the form or size, it means a lot to me!
